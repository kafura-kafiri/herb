                            Hot tea is a popular beverage during cold weather on account of its warmth, flavor, and
                            aroma. Hot tea can also help relieve the aches and pains of the flu and boost the immune
                            system. Many teas that are tailored for consumption in cold weather contain ingredients
                            that can ease breathing and soothe a sore throat.

                            How can you improve your health? The answer could be a spice in your cupboards! Turmeric,

                            often consumed for its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and digestive health properties.
                            Curcumin, a chemical found in turmeric, is believed to provide many of the health

                            the past 4,000 years, turmeric has played an important role in medicine! Today, its use
                            continues to be researched as an alternative treatment approach for many common illnesses,
                            injuries, and chronic diseases.

                            Since the beginning of human civilization, people have sought out the benefits of
                            essential oils. The Egyptians used essential oils during the mummification process and
                            ceremonial celebrations. The oils were highly valued, frequently given as gifts and even
                            traded as currency. In the Bible, the Three Wise Men brought the baby Jesus gifts of gold,
                            frankincense and myrrh—the latter two were essential oils.

                            Muscles, bones, skin and tendons are composed primarily of collagen, the most abundant
                            type of protein in the human body. To be specific, collagen consists of 30-35 percent of
                            all the protein in the human body. Collagen protein is also known as connective tissue and
                            is responsible for stabilizing our skin and maintaining joint movement and flexibility. In
                            addition, collagen provides our skin with elasticity. Studies show that collagen

                                            Garlic has been used throughout history virtually all over the world as a
                                            medicine. Its use predates written history. Sanskrit records document the

                                            of garlic remedies to approximately 5,000 years ago, while the Chinese have
                                            been using it for at least 3,000 years.The Codex Ebers, an Egyptian medical
                                            papyrus dating to about 1,550 B.C., mentions garlic as an effective remedy
                                            for
                                            a variety of ailments, including high blood pressure, headache, bites,

                                            and tumors. Hippocrates, Aristotle and Pliny cited numerous therapeutic uses
                                            for garlic. Stories, verse, and folklore (such as its alleged ability to

                                            off vampires) also give historical documentation to the healing power of
                                            garlic.
